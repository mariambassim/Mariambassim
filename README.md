### Hi there, I'm Mariam!

I'm a first-year student who's passionate about learning programming.  
I have some basic knowledge of JavaScript and I'm excited to explore open-source projects through Google Summer of Code.

I'm here to learn, grow, and contribute to beginner-friendly projects.  
Feel free to check my journey here!

Thanks for stopping by!
